            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Purpose</strong><br>
            The portfolio showcases the depth and breadth of knowledge and skills gained during the Education Specialist (Ed.S.) in Instructional Technology program at Kennesaw State University. It serves as evidence of my ability to integrate technology into instructional design and demonstrates my readiness for leadership roles in educational technology.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective</strong><br>
            The objective was to document and reflect on completed coursework, practical applications, and professional growth. It also highlights key projects, certifications, and achievements aligned with instructional technology standards.</p>
            <p><strong>Role</strong><br>
            As the creator, I assumed the role of both designer and curator, responsible for selecting and presenting artifacts that represent my competencies and growth as an educational technology specialist.</p>
            <p><strong>Duration</strong><br>
            The portfolio was developed over the course of the program, 2 years, with periodic updates to include new projects and reflections.</p>
